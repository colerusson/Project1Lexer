//    Adjacency list implementation (not adjacency matrix)
//    Graph stores all edges/adjacencies as a map<int,set<int>>
//    Also store a boolean 'visited' flag for each node
//    Make all of the functions dfs, dfsForest, etc. in the graph class
//    You should have a two different dfsForest functions:
//    one for finding the post-order, and one for finding SCCs

//    create a toString method early to test each step
